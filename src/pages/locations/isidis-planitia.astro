          Isidis Planitia represents one of Mars' most geologically significant
          ancient impact basins, serving as the intended landing site for the
          ill-fated but scientifically important Beagle 2 mission. This massive
          impact structure, approximately 1,900 kilometers in diameter, holds
          the distinction of being the third-largest confirmed impact basin on
          Mars, formed during the violent early history of the planet
          approximately 3.9 billion years ago.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The basin exposes some of the oldest hydrated crust on Mars, providing
          a unique window into the planet's ancient past when water was more
          abundant and conditions were potentially more hospitable to life. The
          rim of this ancient impact crater preserves evidence of massive
          glaciation events and extensive water-rock interactions that occurred
          billions of years ago.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Recent discoveries have revealed that Isidis Planitia contains
          magnesium carbonate deposits, indicating the presence of ancient
          non-acidic water conditions that would have been favorable for
          potential life. The basin's complex geological history includes
          episodes of volcanic activity, catastrophic flooding, and massive
          glaciation, making it a natural laboratory for understanding Mars'
          climate evolution.

          Isidis Planitia was formed by a catastrophic asteroid or comet impact
          during the Late Heavy Bombardment period of the early solar system.
          The impact was so massive that it created a basin nearly 2,000
          kilometers across, penetrating deep into Mars' crust and exposing
          ancient materials.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">
          This impact basin is believed to be the last major basin-forming

          Hydrated Crust Discovery

          The basin rim exposes some of the oldest hydrated crust on Mars,

          billions of years ago. These ancient hydrated minerals provide direct

          The preservation of these hydrated minerals in the impact basin's

          Magnesium Carbonate Evidence

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mb-4">
          Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected magnesium carbonate around the
          Isidis basin, a mineral that forms only in neutral to alkaline water
          conditions. This discovery indicates that ancient water in this

          potential life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">
          The presence of carbonates suggests that early Mars had a thicker
          atmosphere with higher CO2 levels, supporting theories about a
          warmer, wetter early Mars climate that could have sustained

          Volcanic Cone Formations
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mb-4">
          The basin contains numerous conical landforms interpreted as tuff
          cones formed during explosive magma-ice interactions. These cones,
          300-500 meters in diameter and ~30 meters high, suggest that
          volcanic activity occurred when subsurface ice was present.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">
          The alignment of these cones in chains with characteristic furrows

        Analysis of thermal inertia patterns and geological structures suggests
        that Isidis Planitia has significant potential for subsurface water
        resources. The eroded materials from massive glaciation events were
