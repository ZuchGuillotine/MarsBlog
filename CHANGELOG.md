# Changelog - Mars Location Interactive Cards & Detail Pages

## 🛠️ 2024-06-30: UI Layering & Mobile Bug Fixes

- **Sticky Mars Population Card**: Card is now pinned to the top-left under the header with no extra sidebar spacing, ensuring a clean layout on all devices.
- **Location Cards Always On Top**: Location hover/selected cards now have the highest z-index (`z-1000`), guaranteeing they always appear above the Mars Population card, "Selected:" info, and all other UI elements.
- **Z-Index Hierarchy Improvements**: Refactored z-index values for all overlay elements:
  - Location cards: `z-1000`
  - Mars Population card: `z-30`
  - Info panels: `z-10`/`z-20`
  - Sidebar: `z-50`
- **Mobile Bug Fix**: Removed problematic left-side black spacing that was obscuring the globe and content on mobile. Layout is now fully responsive and unobtrusive.
- **Box Shadow Enhancement**: Location cards now have a stronger shadow for better visibility and separation.
- **Result**: Users can always see and interact with location cards, regardless of what else is on the screen. No more obscured or inaccessible information!

## 🚀 Session Summary (Latest Update)

This session focused on transforming the Mars globe from a static visualization into an interactive exploration tool with clickable location cards and detailed individual pages for each Mars location.

## 🎯 **LATEST: Critical UX Enhancement**

### ✅ **Hover-to-Persist Card System**

- **🔥 Major Fix**: Resolved critical issue where cards disappeared when users tried to click them
- **Immediate Response**: Cards appear instantly on hover for responsive feedback
- **Persistent Interaction**: Cards remain visible after hover ends, enabling user interaction
- **Smart Dismissal**: Multiple ways to close cards (× button, click empty space)
- **Dual-State Logic**: Combines instant hover response with persistent click-based interaction

### 🎮 **Perfected User Flow**

1. **Hover marker** → Card appears immediately
2. **Move cursor to card** → Card stays visible (persistent state)
3. **Click "Explore Details"** → Navigate to location page
4. **Click close (×) or empty space** → Dismiss card

**Result**: Cards are now fully interactive and user-friendly! No more disappearing cards when trying to click them.
